The Capstone Project required by Flatiron School in order to graduate simulates a Cyber Security Engineering role in which you will be tasked with day to day operations and assignments sent to you by the CISO. Each task requires a report to be attached providing evidence of your discoveries. From analysing log files to network discovery to vulnerabiity assessments, the Flatiron School Capstone Project teaches valuable lessons on how to conduct common Cyber Security operations.

Within the Capstone Project, you are hired as a security consultant by a fictitious organization ACME Anvils. You are continuously in contact with the CISO of the organization in which they are tasking you with several assignments each day. Assignments include: researching and suggesting a new and improved internal ticketing system, researching and suggesting possible honeypots for the organization, network discovery, vulnerability assessments, a vulnerability roadmap, and log file analyzation. During this final project, the student has very minimal contact with their instructor, as the assignments must be completed on their own. Below are Elijah Morkle's submissions for the final Capstone Project.
